## Notes

 - Discussion about data generation and curation guide
     - Olga mentioned that "metadata" might need to include a link from the "raw data" in the diagram
     - Olga suggested thinking more carefully about the definition of metadata as used
     - Discussed restarts and that restarts require bespoke method to set up
         - There aren't really any libraries to help with this
	 - Steve, Trevor and David gave useful feedback
 - David sharing slide showing schematic of phase field simulation
     - schematic of phase field simulation
     - David is showing schematic with boxes
     - Olga: link with phase field ontology or vocab
     - Boxes should link to phase field vocab (Katsuyo)
     - Clean up terminology document and make tentative steps to share with others (Katsuyo)
 - Questions regarding creating formal ontology / JSON / lightweight links file from the phase field terminology / schema documents in google
         - Daniel: not really what I'd like to do, but others are welcome
         - Daniel: I'd like to focus on the RO-Crate methodology and then augment that with ideas from those documents
